3. Edit the configuration file to customize settings

### Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "tmdb_api_key": "",
  "download_path": "~/Downloads/Movies",
  "search_limit": 5,
  "order_by": "rating",
  "sort_direction": "desc",
  "auto_vpn": false,
  "custom_trackers": [
    "udp://open.demonii.com:1337/announce",

  ]
}
```
